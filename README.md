# CloudCapture
Cloud Capture, an obj-c camera app from 2014

This project contains obj-c camera related routines that may be of use to you, though some features, especially openGL and Audio use outdated apis.

There is pdf in the Help directory with a user guide, that is probably the fastest way to determine if anything in here is of use in your app.
